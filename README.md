In this challenge, we utilized unsuperised machine learning tools K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies across timeframes across 24 hour, 7 day, 30 day, 60 day, 200 day, and 1 year intervals. 

Completed individually, and in study group collaborations.
